# Missing features / Next steps

## Network traffic
Display accumulated upload / download speeds of all network interfaces.
Can't be bothered with configuring a host-specific network interface at
the moment. Might build my own based on [nicstat](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/nicstat.1.html)


## Swap percentage
Unfortunately the waybar version on Ubuntu
22.04 (0.9.9) does not support swap percentage.
